### API Debug

First start your api service, please change the model path or name as you like
```bash
sh sh/serve_qwen2.5-math-7b-instruct_api.sh
```

Then try to request the api to evaluate. 
- We change the batch_size per request to 1, since we are already doing multiprocessing at data point level, grouping data point into large batches seems unneccessary.
- We modify the get_client_reponse function which support temperature, top_p and so on. Otherwise, you may get totally unexpected results.
```bash
sh sh/dbg_use_api
```


### Requirements
You can install the required packages with the following command:
```bash
cd latex2sympy
pip install -e .
cd ..
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install vllm==0.5.1 --no-build-isolation
pip install transformers==4.42.3
```

### Evaluation
You can evaluate Qwen2.5/Qwen2-Math-Instruct series model with the following command:
```bash
# Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct Series
PROMPT_TYPE="qwen25-math-cot"
# Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH

# Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH

# Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH


# Qwen2-Math-Instruct Series
PROMPT_TYPE="qwen-boxed"
# Qwen2-Math-1.5B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2-Math-1.5B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH

# Qwen2-Math-7B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2-Math-7B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH

# Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3"
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH="Qwen/Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct"
bash sh/eval.sh $PROMPT_TYPE $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH
```
