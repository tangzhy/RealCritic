Recognizing the necessity of the GCD in simplifying fractions is mathematically valid.\n\n### Critique of Step 2\nThe student accurately performs the prime factorization of both numbers:\n- \\(91 = 7 \\times 13\\) is correct since \\(7 \\times 13 = 91\\).\n- \\(26 = 2 \\times 13\\) is also correct because \\(2 \\times 13 = 26\\).\nThis step is mathematically sound and correctly executed.\n\n### Critique of Step 3\nThe student correctly identifies that the only common factor between 91 and 26 is 13. Therefore, determining that the GCD of 91 and 26 is 13 is accurate and logically follows from the prime factorizations found in the previous step.\n\n### Critique of Step 4\nThe student correctly divides both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (13):\n\\[\n\\frac{91 \\div 13}{26 \\div 13} = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\nBoth divisions are performed correctly:\n- \\(91 \\div 13 = 7\\)\n- \\(26 \\div 13 = 2\\)\nThis step is mathematically valid and accurately simplified the fraction.\n\n### Critique of Step 5\nThe student concludes that the simplified form of the fraction \\(\\frac{91}{26}\\) is \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\) and appropriately boxes the final answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}\n\\]\nThis conclusion correctly follows from the previous calculations and presents the final answer in the proper format.\n\n## Conclusion of Critique\nThe solution is Correct.\nThe first error step number: -1\n\n## Correction of Student Solution\nThe student solution is correct and well-reasoned.
