To understand why, consider a smaller set $T=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$. If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$. One such function $f$ is given below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccccccccccccc}\nn & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 \\\\\n\\hline f(n) & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 6 & 6 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 12 & 12 & 20\n\\end{array}\n$$"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "pred": "232792560", "wrong": "To determine the smallest integer \\( p \\) such that the sequence \\( s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots \\) is periodic after a certain point with a period at most \\( p \\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function \\( f \\) and the sequence \\( s_n \\).\n\nFirst, note that \\( f \\) is a function from the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\} \\) to itself.

For an $n$-tuple $\\mathbf{v}$, we will write $\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ for its $i$-th coordinate (where $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ ). For a positive integer $n$ and a tuple $\\mathbf{v}$ we will denote by $n \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ the tuple obtained by applying addition on $\\mathbf{v}$ with itself $n$ times. Furthermore, we denote by $\\mathbf{e}(i)$ the tuple which has $i$-th coordinate equal to one and all the other coordinates equal to zero. We say that a tuple is positive if all its coordinates are positive, and negative if all its coordinates are negative.\n\nWe will show that three tuples suffice, and then that two tuples do not suffice.\n\n**Three tuples suffice.** Write $\\mathbf{c}$ for the constant-valued tuple $\\mathbf{c}=(-1, \\ldots,-1)$.\n\nWe note that it is enough for Lucy to be able to make the tuples $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$, $\\mathbf{c}$; from those any other tuple $\\mathbf{v}$ can be made as follows. First we choose some positive integer $k$ such that $k+\\mathbf{v}_{i}>0$ for all $i$. Then, by adding a positive number of copies of $\\mathbf{c}, \\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$, she can make\n\n$$\nk \\mathbf{c}+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(1)+\\cdots+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(n)\n$$\n\nwhich we claim is equal to $\\mathbf{v}$. Indeed, this can be checked by comparing coordinates: the $i$-th coordinate of the right-hand side is $-k+\\left(k+\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\right)=\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ as needed.\n\nLucy can take her three starting tuples to be $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$, such that $\\mathbf{a}_{i}=-i^{2}, \\mathbf{b}_{i}=i$ and $\\mathbf{c}=-1$ (as above).\n\nFor any $1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$, write $\\mathbf{d}(j)$ for the tuple $2 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}+4 j \\cdot \\mathbf{b}+\\left(2 j^{2}-1\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{c}$, which Lucy can make by adding together $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$ repeatedly.

Hence Lucy can produce the tuple $\\mathbf{1}=(1, \\ldots, 1)$ as $\\mathbf{d}(1) \\vee \\cdots \\vee \\mathbf{d}(n)$.\n\nShe can then produce the constant tuple $\\mathbf{0}=(0, \\ldots, 0)$ as $\\mathbf{1}+\\mathbf{c}$, and for any $1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$ she can then produce the tuple $\\mathbf{e}(j)$ as $\\mathbf{d}(j) \\vee \\mathbf{0}$. Since she can now produce $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$ and already had $\\mathbf{c}$, she can (as we argued earlier) produce any integer-valued tuple.\n\n\n\n**Two tuples do not suffice.** We start with an observation: Let $a$ be a non-negative real number and suppose that two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ satisfy $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ for some $1 \\leqslant j, k \\leqslant n$.

Then $\\mathbf{m}_{j} \\geqslant \\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{m}_{j} \\geqslant \\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$. Since $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ or $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{w}_{k}$, the observation follows.\n\nAs a consequence of this observation we have that if all starting tuples satisfy such an inequality, then all generated tuples will also satisfy it, and so we would not be able to obtain every integer-valued tuple.\n\nLet us now prove that Lucy needs at least three starting tuples. For contradiction, let us suppose that Lucy started with only two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$. We are going to distinguish two cases. In the first case, suppose we can find a coordinate $i$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\geqslant 0$. Both operations preserve the sign, thus we can not generate any tuple that has negative $i$-th coordinate. Similarly for $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\leqslant 0$.\n\nSuppose the opposite, i.e., for every $i$ we have either $\\mathbf{v}_{i}>0>\\mathbf{w}_{i}$, or $\\mathbf{v}_{i}<0<\\mathbf{w}_{i}$. Since we assumed that our tuples have at least three coordinates, by pigeonhole principle there exist two coordinates $j \\neq k$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{w}_{k}$ (because there are only two possible combinations of signs).\n\nWithout loss of generality assume that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}, \\mathbf{v}_{k}>0$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}, \\mathbf{w}_{k}<0$. Let us denote the positive real number $\\mathbf{v}_{j} / \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ by $a$. If $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both inequalities $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ are satisfied. On the other hand, if $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both $\\mathbf{v}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{v}_{j}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{w}_{j}$ are satisfied.

The following observation is also useful to simplify the analysis of strategies for Bob.\n\nObservation A. Consider two consecutive rounds. Suppose that in the first round Bob made a $k$-move and Alice picked the left group, and then in the second round Bob makes an $\\ell$-move, with $\\ell>k$. We may then assume, without loss of generality, that Alice again picks the left group.\n\nProof. Suppose Alice picks the right group in the second round. Then the combined effect of the two rounds is that each of the boxes $B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{\\ell}$ lost two pebbles (and the other boxes are unchanged). Hence this configuration is strictly dominated by that before the first round, and it suffices to consider only Alice's other response.\n\nFor Alice. Alice initially distributes pebbles according to $V_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil}$. Suppose the current configuration of pebbles dominates $V_{i}$. If Bob makes a $k$-move with $k \\geqslant i$ then Alice picks the left group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i+1}$. Likewise, if Bob makes a $k$-move with $k<i$ then Alice picks the right group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i-1}$. Since none of $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{N}$ contains an empty box, Alice can prevent Bob from ever winning.\n\nFor Bob. The key idea in this solution is the following claim.\n\nClaim. If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move. By Observation A, we may suppose Alice always picks the left group. After Bob's $(2 k-1)$-move, the rightmost box becomes empty and Bob wins.\n\nNow, we claim that if $n<M$ then either there already exists an empty box, or there exist a positive integer $k$ and $2 k$ boxes with at most $k$ pebbles each (and thus Bob can force a win). Otherwise, assume each box contains at least 1 pebble, and for each $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, at least $N-(2 k-1)=N+1-2 k$ boxes contain at least $k+1$ pebbles. Summing, there are at least as many pebbles in total as in $V_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil}$; that is, at least $M$ pebbles, as desired.", "We present solutions for the general case of $N>1$ boxes, and write $M=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$ for the claimed answer.

Suppose that in the first round Bob made a $k$-move and Alice picked the left group, and then in the second round Bob makes an $\\ell$-move, with $\\ell>k$.

Hence this configuration is strictly dominated by that before the first round, and it suffices to consider only Alice's other response.\n\n\nFor Alice. Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. Alice starts with the boxes in the configuration $V_{K}$. For each of Bob's $N-1$ possible choices, consider the subset of rounds in which he makes that choice. In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times. This means that the number of pebbles in a box could decrease by at most the number of choices for which Alice would have started by removing a pebble from the group containing that box. These numbers are, for each box,\n\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor,\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right\\rfloor, \\ldots, 1,0,1, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nThese are pointwise less than the numbers of pebbles the boxes started with, meaning that no box ever becomes empty with this strategy.\n\nSo the final answer is $n=960$. In general, if there are $N>1$ boxes, the answer is $n=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$.\n\nCommon remarks. We present solutions for the general case of $N>1$ boxes, and write $M=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$ for the claimed answer. For $1 \\leqslant k<N$, say that Bob makes a $k$-move if he splits the boxes into a left group $\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{k}\\right\\}$ and a right group $\\left\\{B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{N}\\right\\}$. Say that one configuration dominates another if it has at least as many pebbles in each box, and say that it strictly dominates the other configuration if it also has more pebbles in at least one box. (Thus, if Bob wins in some configuration, he also wins in every configuration that it dominates.)\n\nIt is often convenient to consider ' $V$-shaped' configurations; for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant N$, let $V_{i}$ be the configuration where $B_{j}$ contains $1+|j-i|$ pebbles (i.e. where the $i^{\\text {th }}$ box has a single pebble and the numbers increase by one in both directions, so the first box has $i$ pebbles and the last box has $N+1-i$ pebbles). Note that $V_{i}$ contains $\\frac{1}{2} i(i+1)+\\frac{1}{2}(N+1-i)(N+2-i)-1$ pebbles. If $i=\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$, this number equals $M$.\n\nFor Bob. Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side. That is, the numbers of pebbles in $X$ are at least\n\n$$\n\\frac{N}{2}, \\frac{N}{2}-1, \\ldots, 1,1, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}\n\\tag{C}\n$$\n\nwith equality occurring at least once on each side. Bob does an $\\frac{N}{2}$-move. Whichever group Alice chooses, the total number of pebbles is unchanged, and the side from which pebbles are removed now has a box with fewer pebbles than in $(C)$, so the previous case of Bob's strategy can now be applied."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "pred": "60", "wrong": "To determine the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning, we need to analyze the game and the possible strategies for both Alice and Bob.

Exactly one number in such a sequence will be a multiple of 5 , but that number could also be a multiple of 2 and hence share a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. There are several cases to consider, namely whether the sequence starts with an even number or an odd number.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an even number, then the second and fourth numbers are both odd, and at least one of them is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence because it is neither a multiple of 2 nor 3 and hence is at least 5 away from the nearest integer with a common factor. Thus the sequence contains a cromulent element.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an odd number, then again, it contains an odd number that is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, thus the sequence contains a cromulent element. In fact, it contains two such numbers if the first or last number is a multiple of 3 , and if the middle number is a multiple of 3 , then all three odd elements are cromulent.\n\n\nThe minimum number is 1 and the maximum number is 2 .

To show that it is not possible for\n\n\na sequence of six consecutive elements to have zero cromulent elements, consider two cases. If the sequence begins with an even number, that number is not cromulent, and one of the other five elements must be cromulent by the argument in the proof above. A similar argument establishes that one element must be cromulent if the sequence of length 6 begins with an odd number (and thus ends in an even number).\n\nOne example of a sequence of length 6 with two cromulent elements is $1,2,3,4,5,6$, where 1 and 5 are both cromulent.\n\nTo prove that a sequence of length 6 cannot have three cromulent elements, consider that the cromulent elements would all have to be odd, and one of those three would be a multiple of 3 .

So there are $N$ admissible processes, among which $M$ are restricted.\n\nIn every admissible process, restricted or not, each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ goes from off to on, so it is switched an odd number of times; and each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ goes from off to off, so it is switched an even number of times.\n\nNotice that $M>0$; i.e., restricted admissible processes do exist (it suffices to switch each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ just once and then choose one of them and switch it $k-n$ times, which by hypothesis is an even number).\n\nConsider any restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$. Take any lamp $\\ell, 1 \\leq \\ell \\leq n$, and suppose that it was switched $k_{\\ell}$ times. As noticed, $k_{\\ell}$ must be odd. Select arbitrarily an even number of these $k_{\\ell}$ switches and replace each of them by the switch of lamp $n+\\ell$. This can be done in $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ ways (because a $k_{\\ell}$-element set has $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ subsets of even cardinality). Notice that $k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{n}=k$.\n\nThese actions are independent, in the sense that the action involving lamp $\\ell$ does not affect the action involving any other lamp. So there are $2^{k_{1}-1} \\cdot 2^{k_{2}-1} \\cdots 2^{k_{n}-1}=2^{k-n}$ ways of combining these actions. In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$ can be modified in $2^{k-n}$ ways, giving rise to $2^{k-n}$ distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process $\\mathbf{q}$ can be achieved in that way.

So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label $\\ell \\leq n$ also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same. This means that the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ is admissible - and clearly restricted, as the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved in it any more.\n\nIf we now take process $\\mathbf{p}$ and reverse all these replacements, then we obtain process $\\mathbf{q}$.

A fictitious domino is good if it is completely covered by a domino in the arrangement; otherwise, it is bad.\n\n\n\nIf the fictitious dominoes are all good, then the dominoes in the arrangement that cover no fictitious domino, if any, all lie in two triangular regions of side-length $m-1$ at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the board. Colour the cells of the board chess-like and notice that in each of the two triangular regions the number of black cells and the number of white cells differ by $\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$.

A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\n\n\n\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes.

Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty.

For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible.

Consider the set of all length- $k$ strings containing only $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$ which end with a $B$, and remove the string consisting of $k$  $B \\mathrm{~s}$. Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$. Then $2 k \\geq 2 L$, yielding $k>L / 2$.\n\nIn conclusion, the least $k$ with the required property is equal to $L / 2=180180$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "pred": "1", "wrong": "To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that there exists a \\( k \\)-clique with more than 200 elements.

Divide the board into $2 \\times 2$ pieces; we call these pieces blocks. Each block can contain not more than one king (otherwise these two kings would attack each other); hence, by the pigeonhole principle each block must contain exactly one king.\n\nNow assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{T}$ or $\\mathrm{B}$ if a king is placed in its top or bottom half, respectively. Similarly, assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{L}$ or $\\mathrm{R}$ if a king stands in its left or right half. So we define T-blocks, B-blocks, L-blocks, and $R$-blocks. We also combine the letters; we call a block $a T L$-block if it is simultaneously T-block and L-block. Similarly we define TR-blocks, $B L$-blocks, and BR-blocks. The arrangement of blocks determines uniquely the arrangement of kings; so in the rest of the solution we consider the $50 \\times 50$ system of blocks (see Fig. 1). We identify the blocks by their coordinate pairs; the pair $(i, j)$, where $1 \\leq i, j \\leq 50$, refers to the $j$ th block in the $i$ th row (or the $i$ th block in the $j$ th column). The upper-left block is $(1,1)$.\n\nThe system of blocks has the following properties..\n\n$\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ If $(i, j)$ is a B-block then $(i+1, j)$ is a B-block: otherwise the kings in these two blocks can take each other. Similarly: if $(i, j)$ is a T-block then $(i-1, j)$ is a T-block; if $(i, j)$ is an L-block then $(i, j-1)$ is an L-block; if $(i, j)$ is an R-block then $(i, j+1)$ is an R-block.\n\n(ii') Each column contains exactly 25 L-blocks and 25 R-blocks, and each row contains exactly 25 T-blocks and 25 B-blocks. In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns. Similarly, there are exactly 25 L-rows and exactly 25 -rows.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary pair of a T-column and a neighboring B-column (columns with numbers $j$ and $j+1$ ).\n\n<img_3973>\n\nFig. 1\n\n<img_3920>\n\nFig. 2\n\nCase 1. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns.

Suppose that the $j$ th column is a B-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a T-column.

In other words, no two kings can be in adjacent squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2. **Each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings**: This implies a uniform distribution of kings across the board.\n\n### Step 2: Constructing a Valid Arrangement\nTo satisfy the first constraint, we can use a checkerboard pattern where kings are placed only on the black squares or only on the white squares. This ensures that no two kings are adjacent.\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring Uniform Distribution\nWe need to place 25 kings in each row and each column. Since there are 100 rows and 100 columns, and each row and each column must have exactly 25 kings, we need to ensure that the total number of kings is \\(100 \\times 25 = 2500\\).\n\n### Step 4: Using the Checkerboard Pattern\nConsider a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard with alternating black and white squares.

Since there are 100 rows, the total number of ways to place the kings on the black squares is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\binom{50}{25} \\right)^{100}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Considering the White Squares\nSimilarly, if we place kings only on the white squares, the number of ways to place the kings is also:\n\\[\n\\left( \\binom{50}{25} \\right)^{100}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Combining Both Cases\nSince the kings can be placed either on the black squares or on the white squares, the total number of valid arrangements is the sum of the two cases:\n\\[\n2 \\left( \\binom{50}{25} \\right)^{100}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of such arrangements is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2 \\left( \\binom{50}{25} \\right)^{100}}\n\\]", "model": "Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct"}

This gives us\n\n$$\nN=n 2^{n}-\\left(2^{0}+2^{1}+\\cdots+2^{n-1}\\right)=(n-1) 2^{n}+1 .\n$$\n\nIn particular, this means that $(n-2) 2^{n}+1$ cannot be represented as a sum of elements of $A_{n}$.", "The fact that $m=(n-2) 2^{n}+1$ cannot be represented as a sum of elements of $A_{n}$ can also be shown in other ways.

If $a, b$ are integers with $a \\geqslant 0, b \\geqslant 1$, and $a+b<n$, then $a 2^{n}+b$ cannot be written as a sum of elements of $A_{n}$.\n\nProof. The claim is clearly true for $n=2$ (since $a=0, b=1$ is the only possibility). For $n>2$, assume that there exist integers $a, b$ with $a \\geqslant 0, b \\geqslant 1$ and $a+b<n$ as well as elements $m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots, m_{r}$ of $A_{n}$ such that\n\n$$\na 2^{n}+b=m_{1}+m_{2}+\\cdots+m_{r} .\n$$\n\nWe can suppose, without loss of generality, that $m_{1} \\geqslant m_{2} \\geqslant \\cdots \\geqslant m_{r}$. Let $\\ell$ be the largest index for which $m_{\\ell}=2^{n}-1\\left(\\ell=0\\right.$ if $\\left.m_{1} \\neq 2^{n}-1\\right)$. Clearly, $\\ell$ and $b$ must have the same parity.

Moreover, $a-\\ell$ and $(b+\\ell) / 2$ are integers, and $(b+\\ell) / 2 \\geqslant 1$. If $a-\\ell$ was negative, then we would have\n\n$$\na 2^{n}+b \\geqslant \\ell\\left(2^{n}-1\\right) \\geqslant(a+1)\\left(2^{n}-1\\right)=a 2^{n}+2^{n}-a-1\n$$\n\nthus $n \\geqslant a+b+1 \\geqslant 2^{n}$, which is impossible. So $a-\\ell \\geqslant 0$. By the induction hypothesis, we must have $a-\\ell+\\frac{b+\\ell}{2} \\geqslant n-1$, which gives us a contradiction, since\n\n$$\na-\\ell+\\frac{b+\\ell}{2} \\leqslant a-\\ell+b+\\ell-1=a+b-1<n-1\n$$\n\nConsidering the special case $a=n-2, b=1$ now completes the proof.", "Denote by $B_{n}$ the set of all positive integers that can be written as a sum of elements of $A_{n}$. In this solution, we explicitly describe all the numbers in $B_{n}$ by an argument similar to the first solution.\n\nFor a positive integer $n$, we denote by $\\sigma_{2}(n)$ the sum of its digits in the binary representation.

For any two integers $s \\geqslant 1$ and $0 \\leqslant t \\leqslant 2^{n}-1$, the number $m=s 2^{n}-t$ belongs to $B_{n}$ if and only if $s \\geqslant \\sigma_{2}(t)$.\n\nProof. For $t=0$, the statement of the Lemma is obvious, since $m=2 s \\cdot\\left(2^{n}-2^{n-1}\\right)$.\n\nNow suppose that $t \\geqslant 1$, and let\n\n$$\nt=2^{k_{1}}+\\cdots+2^{k_{\\sigma}} \\quad\\left(0 \\leqslant k_{1}<\\cdots<k_{\\sigma} \\leqslant n-1, \\quad \\sigma=\\sigma_{2}(t)\\right)\n$$\n\nbe its binary expansion.

Among all such instances, choose the one for which $m$ is smallest, and let\n\n$$\nm=\\sum_{i=1}^{d}\\left(2^{n}-2^{\\ell_{i}}\\right) \\quad\\left(0 \\leqslant \\ell_{i} \\leqslant n-1\\right)\n$$\n\nbe the corresponding representation. If all the $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}$ 's are distinct, then $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} 2^{\\ell_{i}} \\leqslant \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2^{j}=2^{n}-1$, so one has $s=d$ and $t=\\sum_{i=1}^{d} 2^{\\ell_{i}}$, whence $s=d=\\sigma_{2}(t)$; this is impossible. Therefore, two of the $\\ell_{i}$ 's must be equal, say $\\ell_{d-1}=\\ell_{d}$. Then $m \\geqslant 2\\left(2^{n}-2^{\\ell_{d}}\\right) \\geqslant 2^{n}$, so $s \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow we claim that the number $m^{\\prime}=m-2^{n}=(s-1) 2^{n}-t$ also belongs to $B_{n}$, which contradicts the minimality assumption. Indeed, one has\n\n$$\n\\left(2^{n}-2^{\\ell_{d-1}}\\right)+\\left(2^{n}-2^{\\ell_{d}}\\right)=2\\left(2^{n}-2^{\\ell_{d}}\\right)=2^{n}+\\left(2^{n}-2^{\\ell_{d}+1}\\right),\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\nm^{\\prime}=\\sum_{i=1}^{d-2}\\left(2^{n}-2^{\\ell_{i}}\\right)+\\left(2^{n}-2^{\\ell_{d}+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nis the desired representation of $m^{\\prime}$ (if $\\ell_{d}=n-1$, then the last summand is simply omitted).

The base case $n=1$ is clear. For the induction step, consider any $n$-element subset $S$ of $\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}\\right\\}$, and assume that $S=O(\\mathcal{C})$ for some good configuration $\\mathcal{C}$.

Adjunction of the arrow $a_{k} \\rightarrow a_{k+1}$ to $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ yields a unique good configuration on $2 n$ points, as required.", "Use the counterclockwise labelling $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ in the solution above.\n\nLetting $D_{n}$ be the number of good configurations on $2 n$ points, we establish a recurrence relation for the $D_{n}$. To this end, let $C_{n}=\\frac{(2 n) !}{n !(n+1) !}$ the $n$th Catalan number; it is well-known that $C_{n}$ is the number of ways to connect $2 n$ given points on the circumference by $n$ pairwise disjoint chords.\n\nSince no two arrows cross, in any good configuration the vertex $a_{1}$ is connected to some $a_{2 k}$. Fix $k$ in the range 1 through $n$ and count the number of good configurations containing the arrow $a_{1} \\rightarrow a_{2 k}$. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be any such configuration.\n\nIn $\\mathcal{C}$, the vertices $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{2 k-1}$ are paired off with one other, each arrow pointing from the smaller to the larger index, for otherwise it would form a prohibited quadrangle with $a_{1} \\rightarrow a_{2 k}$.

Finally, it is easily seen that any configuration of the first kind and any configuration of the second kind combine together to yield an overall good configuration.\n\nThus the number of good configurations containing the arrow $a_{1} \\rightarrow a_{2 k}$ is $C_{k-1} D_{n-k}$.

Such a configuration of chords will be referred to as a Catalan n-configuration. An orientation of the chords in a Catalan configuration $\\mathcal{C}$ making it into a good configuration (in the sense defined in the statement of the problem) will be referred to as a good orientation for $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nWe show by induction on $n$ that there are exactly $n+1$ good orientations for any Catalan $n$-configuration, so there are exactly $(n+1) C_{n}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 n \\\\ n\\end{array}\\right)$ good configurations on $2 n$ points. The base case $n=1$ is clear.\n\nFor the induction step, let $n>1$, let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a Catalan $n$-configuration, and let $a b$ be a chord of minimal length in $\\mathcal{C}$. By minimality, the endpoints of the other chords in $\\mathcal{C}$ all lie on the major arc $a b$ of the circumference.\n\nLabel the $2 n$ endpoints $1,2, \\ldots, 2 n$ counterclockwise so that $\\{a, b\\}=\\{1,2\\}$, and notice that the good orientations for $\\mathcal{C}$ fall into two disjoint classes: Those containing the arrow $1 \\rightarrow 2$, and those containing the opposite arrow.\n\nSince the arrow $1 \\rightarrow 2$ cannot be involved in a prohibited quadrangle, the induction hypothesis applies to the Catalan $(n-1)$-configuration formed by the other chords to show that the first class contains exactly $n$ good orientations.\n\nFinally, the second class consists of a single orientation, namely, $2 \\rightarrow 1$, every other arrow emerging from the smaller endpoint of the respective chord; a routine verification shows that this is indeed a good orientation. This completes the induction step and ends the proof.\n\n### solution_3\nWe intend to count the number of good orientations of a Catalan $n$-configuration.\n\nFor each such configuration, we consider its dual graph $T$ whose vertices are finite regions bounded by chords and the circle, and an edge connects two regions sharing a boundary segment. This graph $T$ is a plane tree with $n$ edges and $n+1$ vertices.\n\nThere is a canonical bijection between orientations of chords and orientations of edges of $T$ in such a way that each chord crosses an edge of $T$ from the right to the left of the arrow on that edge. A good orientation of chords corresponds to an orientation of the tree containing no two edges oriented towards each other. Such an orientation is defined uniquely by its source vertex, i.e., the unique vertex having no in-arrows.\n\nTherefore, for each tree $T$ on $n+1$ vertices, there are exactly $n+1$ ways to orient it so that the source vertex is unique - one for each choice of the source.

By hypothesis, $\\mathcal{G}$ has exactly 4 edges of each color.\n\nClaim. The graph $\\mathcal{G}$ contains at most one circuit.\n\nProof. Note that all the connected components of $\\mathcal{G}$ are monochromatic and hence contain at most four edges. Thus also all circuits of $\\mathcal{G}$ are monochromatic and have length at most four. Moreover, each component contains at most one circuit since otherwise it should contain at least five edges.\n\nSuppose that there is a 4-cycle in $\\mathcal{G}$, say with vertices $a, b, c$, and $d$ in order. Then $\\{a+b, b+$ $c, c+d, d+a\\}=\\{15,16,17,19\\}$. Taking sums we get $2(a+b+c+d)=15+16+17+19$ which is impossible for parity reasons. Thus all circuits of $\\mathcal{G}$ are triangles.\n\nNow if the vertices $a, b$, and $c$ form such a triangle, then by a similar reasoning the set $\\{a+b, b+$ $c, c+a\\}$ coincides with either $\\{15,16,17\\}$, or $\\{15,16,19\\}$, or $\\{16,17,19\\}$, or $\\{15,17,19\\}$.

Thus, a component containing a circuit should contain 9 as a vertex. Therefore there is at most one such component and hence at most one circuit.\n\nBy now we know that $\\mathcal{G}$ is a graph with $4 k$ edges, at least $k$ components and at most one circuit.

We distinguish two cases.\n\nCase 1: $X \\cap M_{1} \\neq \\varnothing$.\n\nA cube from $X \\cap M_{1}$ should appear in all three boxes $X, Y$, and $Z$, so it should lie in $X \\cap Y \\cap Z$. Thus $X \\cap M_{1}=X \\cap Y \\cap Z$ and $\\left|X \\cap M_{1}\\right|=1$.\n\nConsider now the cubes in $X \\cap M_{2}$. There are at most $2(n-1)$ of them lying in $X \\cap Y$ or $X \\cap Z$ (because the cube from $X \\cap Y \\cap Z$ is in $M_{1}$ ). Let $a$ be some other cube from $X \\cap M_{2}$.

Indeed, $X \\cap M_{2}$ contains at most $2 n-1$ cubes from $X \\cap Y$ or $X \\cap Z$. Any other cube $a$ in $X \\cap M_{2}$ corresponds to some $a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z$ (possibly with $a^{\\prime} \\in X$ ), so there are at most $n$ of them.

Therefore, every nonempty set that appears in one group for $B$ still shows up in all possible orientations (it is possible that an empty set of colors in $B$ only matched $X, Y$ or $Z$ before these were thrown away, but remember we do not require empty sets to match anyway). In summary, $B$ is also strange.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we may assume that $B$ has at most $\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}$ colors.

There are only $n-1$ differences $a_{j}-a_{i}$ with $j=i+1$, so there exists an exponent $e \\leqslant n$ and a difference $a_{j}-a_{i}$ with $j \\geqslant i+2$ such that $a_{j}-a_{i}=r^{e}$.

In this case, we clearly have $a_{5}-a_{1}=r^{10}$.

That is, the \"large\" exponents keep dropping by 1 , while the \"small\" exponents keep increasing by $n-2, n-3, \\ldots, 2$. Comparing any two such equations, we then get a contradiction unless $n \\leqslant 4$.\n\nNow we go back to the full proof for any $n \\geqslant 5$. Denote $b=\\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)$. Clearly, we have $a_{n}-a_{1}=r^{b}$. Consider the $n-2$ equations of the form:\n\n$$\na_{n}-a_{1}=\\left(a_{n}-a_{i}\\right)+\\left(a_{i}-a_{1}\\right) \\text { for } i \\in\\{2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\n$$\n\nIn each equation, one of the two terms on the right-hand side must be at least $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_{n}-a_{1}\\right)$. But from the lemma we have $r^{b-(n-1)}=r^{b} / r^{n-1}<\\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_{n}-a_{1}\\right)$, so there are at most $n-2$ sufficiently large elements in $\\left\\{r^{k} \\mid 1 \\leqslant k<b\\right\\}$, namely $r^{b-1}, \\ldots, r^{b-(n-2)}$ (note that $r^{b}$ is already used for $a_{n}-a_{1}$ ). Thus, the \"large\" terms must be, in some order, precisely equal to elements in\n\n$$\nL=\\left\\{r^{b-1}, \\ldots, r^{b-(n-2)}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNext we claim that the \"small\" terms in the $n-2$ equations must be equal to the elements in\n\n$$\nS=\\left\\{r^{b-(n-2)-\\frac{1}{2} i(i+1)} \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-2\\right\\}\n$$\n\n\n\nin the corresponding order (the largest \"large\" term with the smallest \"small\" term, etc.).

Putting these $2 \\times 2$ squares on the diagonal of a $4 \\times 4$ square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on $N$; actually, above we have proved the base case $N=4$. For the induction step, assume that $N>4$, consider any $2^{N-2}+1$ flags of length $N$, and arrange them into a large flag of size $\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N$. This flag contains a non-monochrome column since the flags are distinct; we may assume that this column is the first one. By the pigeonhole principle, this column contains at least $\\left\\lceil\\frac{2^{N-2}+1}{2}\\right\\rceil=2^{N-3}+1$ squares of one color (say, blue). We call the flags with a blue first square good.\n\nConsider all the good flags and remove the first square from each of them. We obtain at least $2^{N-3}+1 \\geq M_{N-1}$ flags of length $N-1$; by the induction hypothesis, $N-1$ of them\n\n\n\ncan form a square $Q$ with the monochrome diagonal. Now, returning the removed squares, we obtain a rectangle $(N-1) \\times N$, and our aim is to supplement it on the top by one more flag.\n\nIf $Q$ has a yellow diagonal, then we can take each flag with a yellow first square (it exists by a choice of the first column; moreover, it is not used in $Q$ ). Conversely, if the diagonal of $Q$ is blue then we can take any of the $\\geq 2^{N-3}+1-(N-1)>0$ remaining good flags. So, in both cases we get a desired $N \\times N$ square.", "We present a different proof of the estimate $M_{N} \\leq 2^{N-2}+1$. We do not use the induction, involving Hall's lemma on matchings instead.\n\nConsider arbitrary $2^{N-2}+1$ distinct flags and arrange them into a large $\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N$ flag. Construct two bipartite graphs $G_{\\mathrm{y}}=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)$ and $G_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$ with the common set of vertices as follows. Let $V$ and $V^{\\prime}$ be the set of columns and the set of flags under consideration, respectively. Next, let the edge $(c, f)$ appear in $E_{\\mathrm{y}}$ if the intersection of column $c$ and flag $f$ is yellow, and $(c, f) \\in E_{\\mathrm{b}}$ otherwise. Then we have to prove exactly that one of the graphs $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$ contains a matching with all the vertices of $V$ involved.\n\nAssume that these matchings do not exist. By Hall's lemma, it means that there exist two sets of columns $S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\subset V$ such that $\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|-1$ and $\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|-1$ (in the left-hand sides, $E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$ denote respectively the sets of all vertices connected to $S_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{b}}$ in the corresponding graphs). Our aim is to prove that this is impossible. Note that $S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq V$ since $N \\leq 2^{N-2}+1$.\n\nFirst, suppose that $S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq \\varnothing$, so there exists some $c \\in S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}$. Note that each flag is connected to $c$ either in $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ or in $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$, hence $E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)=V^{\\prime}$. Hence we have $2^{N-2}+1=\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right|+\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|+\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|-2 \\leq 2 N-4$; this is impossible for $N \\geq 4$.\n\nSo, we have $S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\varnothing$. Let $y=\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|, b=\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|$. From the construction of our graph, we have that all the flags in the set $V^{\\prime \\prime}=V^{\\prime} \\backslash\\left(E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right)$ have blue squares in the columns of $S_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and yellow squares in the columns of $S_{\\mathrm{b}}$. Hence the only undetermined positions in these flags are the remaining $N-y-b$ ones, so $2^{N-y-b} \\geq\\left|V^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\geq\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right|-\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right|-\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\geq$ $2^{N-2}+1-(y-1)-(b-1)$, or, denoting $c=y+b, 2^{N-c}+c>2^{N-2}+2$.

Otherwise, let $2 \\leqslant q \\leqslant 2017$ be the minimal index with $a_{q}<1$. We have $S(q, i)=i$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, q-1$, while $S(q, q)=q-1$. Therefore, $a_{q}<1$ yields $a_{q}=S(q, q) / q=1-\\frac{1}{q}$.\n\nNow we have $S(q+1, i)=i-\\frac{1}{q}$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, q$, and $S(q+1, q+1)=q-\\frac{1}{q}$.

We keep the same notations of $S(n, k), m_{n}$ and $M_{n}$ from the previous solution.\n\nNotice that $S(n, n)=S(n, n-1)$, as $a_{0}=0$. Also notice that for $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant \\ell \\leqslant n$ we have $S(n, \\ell)=S(n, k)+S(n-k, \\ell-k)$.\n\nClaim 2. For every positive integer $n$, we have $m_{n} \\leqslant m_{n+1}$ and $M_{n+1} \\leqslant M_{n}$, so the segment $\\left[m_{n+1}, M_{n+1}\\right]$ is contained in $\\left[m_{n}, M_{n}\\right]$.\n\nProof. Choose a positive integer $k \\leqslant n+1$ such that $m_{n+1}=S(n+1, k) / k$. Then we have\n\n$$\nk m_{n+1}=S(n+1, k)=a_{n}+S(n, k-1) \\geqslant m_{n}+(k-1) m_{n}=k m_{n},\n$$\n\nwhich establishes the first inequality in the Claim. The proof of the second inequality is similar.\n\nClaim 3. For every positive integers $k \\geqslant n$, we have $m_{n} \\leqslant a_{k} \\leqslant M_{n}$.\n\nProof. By Claim 2, we have $\\left[m_{k}, M_{k}\\right] \\subseteq\\left[m_{k-1}, M_{k-1}\\right] \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq\\left[m_{n}, M_{n}\\right]$. Since $a_{k} \\in\\left[m_{k}, M_{k}\\right]$, the claim follows.\n\nClaim 4. For every integer $n \\geqslant 2$, we have $M_{n}=S(n, n-1) /(n-1)$ and $m_{n}=S(n, n) / n$.\n\nProof. We use induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is routine. To perform the induction step, we need to prove the inequalities\n\n$$\n\\frac{S(n, n)}{n} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, n-1)}{n-1}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nfor every positive integer $k \\leqslant n$. Clearly, these inequalities hold for $k=n$ and $k=n-1$, as $S(n, n)=S(n, n-1)>0$. In the sequel, we assume that $k<n-1$.\n\nNow the first inequality in (1) rewrites as $n S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n, n)=k(S(n, k)+S(n-k, n-k))$, or, cancelling the terms occurring on both parts, as\n\n$$\n(n-k) S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n-k, n-k) \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\geqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have $S(n-k, n-k) /(n-k)=m_{n-k}$. By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. Summing these $k$ inequalities we obtain\n\n$$\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly. Indeed, this inequality is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n, n-1) & \\Longleftrightarrow(n-k-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n-k, n-k-1) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\leqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k-1)}{n-k-1}=k M_{n-k} ;\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthe last inequality follows again from Claim 3, as each term in $S(n, k)$ is at most $M_{n-k}$.\n\nNow we can prove the required estimate for $a_{2018}-a_{2017}$. Set $N=2017$. By Claim 4 ,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{N+1}-a_{N} \\leqslant M_{N+1}-a_{N}=\\frac{S(N+1, N)}{N}-a_{N} & =\\frac{a_{N}+S(N, N-1)}{N}-a_{N} \\\\\n& =\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}-\\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdot a_{N} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, the same Claim yields\n\n$$\na_{N} \\geqslant m_{N}=\\frac{S(N, N)}{N}=\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}\n$$\n\nNoticing that each term in $S(N, N-1)$ is at most 1 , so $S(N, N-1) \\leqslant N-1$, we finally obtain\n\n$$\na_{N+1}-a_{N} \\leqslant \\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}-\\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}=\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N^{2}} \\leqslant \\frac{N-1}{N^{2}} .\n$$"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "pred": "0", "wrong": "To find the maximal possible value of \\(a_{2018} - a_{2017}\\), we start by analyzing the given recurrence relation for the sequence \\(a_n\\).

Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$. This proves that $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$.\n\nSuppose that $n=N$ is the smallest positive integer for which $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThen $N$ must be odd:\n\nIf $N$ was even, then by (F1), $T(N-3)=T(N)>2010$ and so $n=N-3$ would be an integer smaller than $N$ with $T(n)>2010$. This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 . In this case, $a=154-\\frac{1}{2} c$ and $b=155-\\frac{1}{2} c$.\n\nTherefore, if $c$ is even, there are $\\left(154-\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible triples.\n\nIn general, if $c$ is odd, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible.\n\nSince $c$ is odd, then $309-c$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ can be equal. In this case, $a=\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)$.

The claim is true for $n=0$ as, when there are no walls, the plane forms a single region. When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$. Consider adding the edges of $G$ sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one. Therefore the number of connected components of $\\mathrm{G}$ is at least $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1-\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=n+1$. If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.", "We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is \"on the right\" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur's actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "pred": "\\lfloor\\frac{n(n+1)+2}{4}\\rfloor", "wrong": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the structure of the labyrinth and the movement of the knights. The labyrinth is formed by \\( n \\) walls, each of which is an infinite straight line, with no two walls parallel and no three walls intersecting at a common point. This configuration divides the plane into \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 \\) regions.\n\nEach intersection of two walls creates a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners where sides of different colors meet. This means that each intersection allows knights to move between two regions that are adjacent across the intersection.\n\nThe key observation is that the regions of the labyrinth can be colored in a checkerboard pattern, where no two adjacent regions share the same color.

To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$. Choosing $x$ large enough, we can achieve that at least one of these two statements holds; then both hold, which is only possible if $b=1$, as desired."], "answer_type": "Interval", "subfield": "Algebra", "pred": "0", "wrong": "To determine the possible values of \\( P(0) \\) for the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) with real coefficients that satisfies the given property, we start by analyzing the condition given in the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\text{ if and only if } \\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y|\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\( x = 0 \\).

To do this we color the cells with four colors $A, B, C$ and $D$ in the following way: for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,0) \\bmod 2$ use $A$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,1) \\bmod 2$ use $B$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,0) \\bmod 2$ use $C$ and for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,1) \\bmod 2$ use $D$. From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell. Hence, to connect these two parts of the path, there must be\n\n\n\na path connecting the cell $(a, b+3)$ and $(a, b)$ and also a path connecting $(a+2, b+2)$ and $(a-1, b+2)$.\n\nBut these four cells are opposite vertices of a convex quadrilateral and the paths are outside of that quadrilateral and hence they must intersect. This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside. Thus the path between these two points must cross the previous path.\n\nBut an intersection is only possible if a cell is visited twice. This is a contradiction.\n\nHence the number of cells visited is at most $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nThe following picture indicates a recursive construction for all $n \\times n$-chessboards with $n \\equiv 3$ mod 4 which clearly yields a path that misses exactly one $A$-cell (marked with a dot, the center cell of the $15 \\times 15$-chessboard) and hence, in the case of $n=999$ crosses exactly $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$ cells.\n\n<img_3771>"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "pred": "1996002", "wrong": "To determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board, we need to consider the constraints and properties of the limp rook's movement. The limp rook can move to any adjacent square and each move must be a turn, meaning the directions of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the movement pattern. If the limp rook starts at a square \\((i, j)\\), it can move to one of the four adjacent squares: \\((i+1, j)\\), \\((i-1, j)\\), \\((i, j+1)\\), or \\((i, j-1)\\). After moving to one of these squares, the next move must be perpendicular to the previous one. For example, if the limp rook moves from \\((i, j)\\) to \\((i+1, j)\\), the next move can only be to \\((i+1, j+1)\\) or \\((i+1, j-1)\\).\n\nThis movement pattern implies that the limp rook's path will form a sequence of squares where each square is visited exactly once and the path forms a closed loop (since it is cyclic). To maximize the length of this path, we need to cover as many squares as possible without intersecting itself.\n\nA key insight is that the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route on a \\(n \\times n\\) board is \\(2n(n-1)\\) squares. This can be achieved by covering all squares except for one row or one column. For a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board, the longest possible route is \\(2 \\times 999 \\times 998 = 1996002\\) squares.\n\nTo see why this is true, consider a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board. If we remove one row, we are left with a \\(999 \\times 998\\) board. We can cover all \\(999 \\times 998\\) squares by starting at one corner and moving in a pattern that ensures each move is a turn and each square is visited exactly once. The path will form a closed loop, and the number of squares visited will be \\(999 \\times 998\\). Since the path is cyclic, we can repeat this pattern in the other direction (e.g., starting from the opposite corner and moving in the opposite direction) to cover another \\(999 \\times 998\\) squares, giving a total of \\(2 \\times 999 \\times 998 = 1996002\\) squares.\n\nTherefore, the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board is \\(\\boxed{1996002}\\).", "model": "Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct"}

This means that the polynomial on the left side should not equal the polynomial on the right side for any real \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 3: Symmetry and Parity\nConsider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of factors on each side. If both sides have an even number of factors, the resulting polynomials will have the same degree and the same leading coefficient (positive). If both sides have an odd number of factors, the resulting polynomials will also have the same degree and the same leading coefficient (negative).\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring No Real Roots\nTo ensure no real roots, we need to create a situation where the polynomials on both sides have different degrees or different leading coefficients. This can be achieved by making one side have an odd number of factors and the other side have an even number of factors.\n\n### Step 5: Minimum Number of Erasures\nTo achieve this, we need to erase the minimum number of factors such that one side has an odd number of factors and the other side has an even number of factors. The original equation has 2016 factors on each side, which is an even number.\n\n- If we erase one factor from one side, that side will have 2015 factors (odd).\n- The other side will still have 2016 factors (even).\n\nThus, by erasing one factor from one side, we achieve the desired condition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe least number of linear factors one needs to erase to achieve the goal is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]", "model": "Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct"}

Thus $E(2001,501)>4$.\n\nTo solve the puzzle in five minutes, Elizabeth can flip the following sets of switches:\n\n- in the first minute, $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 501\\}$;\n- in the second minute, $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 102\\}$ and $\\{502,503,504, \\ldots, 900\\}$;\n- in the third minute, $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 102\\}$ and $\\{901,902,903, \\ldots, 1299\\}$;\n- in the fourth minute, $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 100\\}$ and $\\{1300,1301,1302, \\ldots, 1700\\}$;\n- in the fifth minute, $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 100\\}$ and $\\{1701,1702,1703, \\ldots, 2001\\}$.\n\nThis results in switches $1,2,3, \\ldots, 100$ being flipped five times, switches 101 and 102 being flipped three times, and the remaining switches being flipped exactly once, so that all the lights are on at the end of the fifth minute."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "pred": "3", "wrong": "To determine \\( E(2001, 501) \\), we need to analyze the problem of flipping exactly 501 out of 2001 light switches each minute to turn all 2001 switches on.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - All 2001 switches are initially off.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Turn all 2001 switches on in the minimum number of minutes.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - Each minute, exactly 501 switches must be flipped.\n\n4. **Parity Consideration:**\n   - Flipping a switch an even number of times leaves it in its original state.\n   - Flipping a switch an odd number of times changes its state from off to on or on to off.\n\n5. **Total Flips Required:**\n   - To turn all 2001 switches on, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times.\n\n6. **Total Flips in \\( m \\) Minutes:**\n   - In \\( m \\) minutes, the total number of flips is \\( 501m \\).\n\n7. **Parity of Total Flips:**\n   - For each switch to be flipped an odd number of times, the total number of flips \\( 501m \\) must be odd.\n   - Since 501 is odd, \\( 501m \\) is odd if and only if \\( m \\) is odd.\n\n8. **Minimum \\( m \\) to Ensure All Switches are On:**\n   - We need to find the smallest odd \\( m \\) such that each switch can be flipped an odd number of times.\n\n9. **Feasibility Check:**\n   - We need to check if it is possible to flip each switch an odd number of times in \\( m \\) minutes.\n   - Consider the total number of flips per switch.

Hence, (4) reduces to\n\n$$\nf(1+f(y+1))+f(y)=1+f(y+1)+y .\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nAccordingly, if both $y_{0}$ and $y_{0}+1$ are fixed points of $f$, then so is $y_{0}+2$.

To start solving this equation, we should look for patterns or specific values of $x$ and $y$ that simplify the equation.\n\n## Step 2: Setting $x = y = 0$\nSetting $x = y = 0$ in the given equation gives us $f(f(0)) + f(0) = 0 + f(0)$. This simplifies to $f(f(0)) = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Setting $y = 0$\nSetting $y = 0$ in the original equation gives us $f(x + f(x)) + f(0) = x + f(x)$. This implies $f(x + f(x)) = x$ for all $x$, since we found $f(0) = 0$ from the previous step.\n\n## Step 4: Substituting $y = f(x)$\nSubstituting $y = f(x)$ into the original equation gives us $f(x + f(x + f(x))) + f(x f(x)) = x + f(x + f(x)) + f(x)^2$. Given that $f(x + f(x)) = x$ from Step 3, this simplifies to $f(x) + f(x f(x)) = x + x + f(x)^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplification and Further Analysis\nSince $f(x + f(x)) = x$, we can substitute $x$ with $x + f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) + f(x f(x)) = x + x + f(x)^2$ to get $x + f((x + f(x)) f(x)) = x + x + f(x)^2$. This simplifies to $f((x + f(x)) f(x)) = x + f(x)^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Identifying a Pattern\nNotice that $f(x + f(x)) = x$ implies that $f(x)$ must be a function that, when added to its input, results in a value that, when input into $f$, gives the original input. This is a strong hint towards $f(x)$ being a linear function, specifically $f(x) = -x$ or $f(x) = x$, but given the nature of the equation, $f(x) = -x$ seems more plausible as it fits the pattern observed.\n\n## Step 7: Verifying the Solution\nLet's verify if $f(x) = -x$ satisfies the original equation. Substituting $f(x) = -x$ into the original equation gives us $-x - (x + y) - xy = x - (x + y) - y(-x)$. Simplifying both sides confirms that $f(x) = -x$ is indeed a solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-x}$", "model": "Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}

We need to find the value of $a_{a_{a_{3}}}$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the relationship between terms in an arithmetic sequence\nIn an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. This constant is called the common difference, denoted as $d$. Therefore, we can express the $n^{th}$ term of the sequence as $a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the common difference $d$\nWe are given that $a_{a_{2}}=100$. Since $a_{2}$ is the second term, we can express it as $a_{2} = a_{1} + d = 10 + d$. We also know that $a_{a_{2}} = 100$, so we can write $a_{a_{2}} = a_{1} + (a_{2}-1)d = 100$. Substituting $a_{2} = 10 + d$ into this equation, we get $a_{1} + (10+d-1)d = 100$. Simplifying this equation, we get $10 + 9d + d^{2} = 100$. Rearranging the equation, we get a quadratic equation $d^{2} + 9d - 90 = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation for $d$\nWe can factor the quadratic equation $d^{2} + 9d - 90 = 0$ as $(d+15)(d-6)=0$. This gives us two possible values for $d$: $d=-15$ or $d=6$. However, since the sequence consists of positive integers, the common difference $d$ must be positive. Therefore, we take $d=6$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of $a_{2}$\nNow that we have the common difference $d=6$, we can find the value of $a_{2}$. We know that $a_{2} = a_{1} + d = 10 + 6 = 16$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the value of $a_{3}$\nUsing the same formula, we can find the value of $a_{3}$.

So, we have $x-8=0$ and $x+2=0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=8$ and $x=-2$.\n\n## Step 6: Check the values of x\nHowever, we need to check if both values of $x$ are valid. Since the original equation involves $\\log _{10}x$, $x$ must be positive. Therefore, $x=-2$ is not a valid solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$", "model": "Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}

Given the recursive definition, we can express each term as a function of the two preceding terms.\n\n## Step 3: Express $u_4$ in terms of $u_3$ and $u_2$\nSince we are not given $u_2$ directly, we cannot immediately calculate $u_4$ using the recursive formula. However, we can express $u_4$ in terms of $u_3$ and $u_2$: $u_4 = 3u_3 - u_2$.\n\n## Step 4: Express $u_5$ in terms of $u_4$ and $u_3$\nUsing the recursive formula, $u_5 = 3u_4 - u_3$.

Substituting the expressions for $u_5$ and $u_4$ from previous steps, we get $89 = 3(8u_3 - 3u_2) - (3u_3 - u_2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $u_2$ using the given values of $u_3$ and $u_6$\nSubstituting $u_3 = 5$ into the equation from Step 5, we get $89 = 3(8(5) - 3u_2) - (3(5) - u_2)$.

Substituting these values into the equation gives us $f(1+f(1))+1=f(1) f(1)+1$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplifying the Equation\nSimplifying the equation from Step 2, we get $f(1+f(1)) = f(1)^2$. This gives us an initial relationship between the function values.\n\n## Step 4: Setting $y = 1$ for General $x$\nNext, let's set $y = 1$ for a general $x$ to see if we can derive a more general relationship. Substituting $y = 1$ into the original equation gives us $f(x+f(x))+1=f(x) f(1)+1$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplifying the General Equation\nSimplifying the equation from Step 4, we get $f(x+f(x)) = f(x) f(1)$.

Consider an arbitrary prime $p$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exists some $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $p \\mid f(x)$. Let\n$$\nd=\\min \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}: p \\mid f(x)\\}\n$$\nBy induction on $k$, we obtain that $p \\mid f(k d)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The base is true since $p \\mid f(d)$. Moreover, if $p \\mid f(k d)$ and $p \\mid f(d)$ then, by the problem condition, $p \\mid f(k d+d)=f((k+1) d)$ as required.\n\nSuppose that there exists an $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $d \\not x$ but $p \\mid f(x)$. Let\n$$\ny=\\min \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}: d \\nmid x, p \\mid f(x)\\} .\n$$\nBy the choice of $d$, we have $y>d$, and $y-d$ is a positive integer not divisible by $d$.

Hence, there is no such $x$, and\n$$\np|f(x) \\Longleftrightarrow d| x .\\tag{1}\n$$\nTake arbitrary $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $x \\equiv y(\\bmod d)$. We have $p \\mid f(x+(2 x d-x))=f(2 x d)$; moreover, since $d \\mid 2 x d+(y-x)=y+(2 x d-x)$, we get $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$. Then by the problem condition $p|f(x)+f(2 x d-x), p| f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$, and hence $f(x) \\equiv-f(2 x d-x) \\equiv f(y)$ $(\\bmod p)$.\n\nOn the other hand, assume that $f(x) \\equiv f(y)(\\bmod p)$. Again we have $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)$ which by our assumption implies that $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$. Hence by the problem condition $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$. Using (1) we get $0 \\equiv y+(2 x d-x) \\equiv y-x$ $(\\bmod d)$.\n\nThus, we have proved that\n$$\nx \\equiv y \\quad(\\bmod d) \\Longleftrightarrow f(x) \\equiv f(y) \\quad(\\bmod p)\\tag{2}\n$$\nWe are left to show that $p=d$ : in this case (1) and (2) provide the desired statements.\n\nThe numbers $1,2, \\ldots, d$ have distinct residues modulo $d$. By (2), numbers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots$, $f(d)$ have distinct residues modulo $p$; hence there are at least $d$ distinct residues, and $p \\geq d$.

By (2), all these $x_{i}$ 's have distinct residues modulo $d$. For the same reasons, $d \\geq p$. Hence, $d=p$.\n\nNow we prove that $f(n)=n$ by induction on $n$. If $n=1$ then, by the Lemma, $p \\nmid f(1)$ for any prime $p$, so $f(1)=1$, and the base is established. Suppose that $n>1$ and denote $k=f(n)$. Note that there exists a prime $q \\mid n$, so by the Lemma $q \\mid k$ and $k>1$.\n\nIf $k>n$ then $k-n+1>1$, and there exists a prime $p \\mid k-n+1$; we have $k \\equiv n-1$ $(\\bmod p)$.

This rule clearly satisfies all three conditions, and the rules corresponding to different $k$ are all different. Thus there are at least $n$ different rules.\n\nPart II. Now we have to prove that there is no other way to define such a rule. Suppose that our rule satisfies the conditions, and let $k \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ be minimal with the property that\n\n$$\nA_{k}=\\{1,2, \\ldots, k, n+k+1, n+k+2, \\ldots, 2 n\\} \\prec B_{k}=\\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, n+k\\} .\n$$\n\nClearly, such a $k$ exists, since this holds for $k=n$ by assumption.

For $n=1$, there is trivially only one rule in view of the second condition.\n\nIn the following, we assume that our claim (namely, that there are no possible rules other than those given in Part I) holds for $n-1$ in place of $n$. We start with the following observation: Claim. At least one of the two relations\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})\n$$\n\nholds.\n\nProof. Suppose that the first relation does not hold. Since our rule may only depend on the relative order, we must also have\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\}) .\n$$\n\nLikewise, if the second relation does not hold, then we must also have\n\n$$\n(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\}) .\n$$\n\nNow condition 3 implies that\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\}),\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts the second condition.\n\nNow we distinguish two cases, depending on which of the two relations actually holds:\n\nFirst case: $(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})$.\n\nLet $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ be two disjoint sets, both in increasing order. We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$. Thus $A<B_{x}-\\varepsilon$, but $A>B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, if $y>x$, then $B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon$ by condition 2, while otherwise the relative order of\n\n\n\nthe elements in $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right)$ is the same as for the two sets $\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$ and $\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$, so that $B_{x}-\\varepsilon<B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. In either case, we obtain\n\n$$\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon<A,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3 .\n\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on $a_{1}, b_{1}$. Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint. The rule $<^{*}$ satisfies all conditions again, so by the induction hypothesis, there exists an index $i$ such that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$. This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$. Set $-A=\\{-a \\mid a \\in A\\}$ for any $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. For any two disjoint sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ of cardinality $n$, we write $A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ to mean $(-B) \\prec(-A)$. It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$.

The roots of a polynomial are the values of $x$ that make the polynomial equal to zero. So, if $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots of $P(x)$, that means $P(r_1) = P(r_2) = 0$.\n\nNow, let's look at the polynomial $Q(x)$. It has roots $r_1 + 1$ and $r_2 + 1$. That means $Q(r_1 + 1) = Q(r_2 + 1) = 0$.\n\nWe know that the roots of a polynomial are related to its coefficients. Specifically, if a polynomial has roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, then it can be written in the form $a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient.\n\nSo, we can write $P(x)$ as $1(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, and $Q(x)$ as $1(x - (r_1 + 1))(x - (r_2 + 1))$.\n\nExpanding $Q(x)$ gives $Q(x) = (x - r_1 - 1)(x - r_2 - 1)$.\n\nExpanding this gives $Q(x) = x^2 - (r_1 + r_2 + 2)x + (r_1 + 1)(r_2 + 1)$.\n\nWe know that the sum of the roots of $P(x)$ is $-T$ (because the sum of the roots is the negation of the coefficient of $x$), and the product of the roots is $800$ (because the product of the roots is the constant term).\n\nSo, the sum of the roots of $Q(x)$ is $-(r_1 + r_2 + 2) = -(-T - 2) = T + 2$, and the product of the roots of $Q(x)$ is $(r_1 + 1)(r_2 + 1) = 800 + 1 = 801$.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients of $Q(x)$ is the sum of the roots plus the constant term, which is $T + 2 + 801 = T + 803$.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients of $Q(x)$ is $\\boxed{803}$.", "model": "Deepseek-math-7b-instruct"}

Suppose that Marty traveled a distance of $d$. Then because Sam's speed is $\\frac{S}{M}$ of Marty's speed, Sam will have traveled a distance of $\\frac{S}{M} \\cdot d$. Thus, together, they traveled $d+\\frac{S}{M} \\cdot d$. Setting this equal to 100 and solving yields $d=\\frac{100 M}{M+S}$. Thus Sam traveled $\\frac{S}{M} \\cdot d=\\frac{100 S}{M+S}$.
