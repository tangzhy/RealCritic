For example, if the system of equations is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 \\\\\n   a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2 \\\\\n   \\vdots \\\\\n   a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   then the augmented matrix is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n   a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} & b_1 \\\\\n   a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} & b_2 \\\\\n   \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n   a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn} & b_m\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Conditions for a Unique Solution**:\n   A system of linear equations has a unique solution if and only if the rank of the coefficient matrix is equal to the rank of the augmented matrix and both ranks are equal to the number of variables (i.e., the number of columns in the coefficient matrix). In other words, if the coefficient matrix is an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix, then the system has a unique solution if and only if:\n   \\[\n   \\text{rank}(A) = \\text{rank}([A|b]) = n\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) is the coefficient matrix and \\([A|b]\\) is the augmented matrix.\n\n3. **Pivot Columns**:\n   In the context of row reduction (Gaussian elimination), a pivot column is a column that contains a leading 1 (a pivot) after the matrix is transformed into row echelon form. The number of pivot columns in a matrix is equal to its rank. Therefore, for the system to have a unique solution, the augmented matrix must have \\(n\\) pivot columns, where \\(n\\) is the number of variables.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Since the rank of the augmented matrix must be equal to the number of variables for the system to have a unique solution, the augmented matrix must have a pivot in every column of the coefficient matrix. This means that the first \\(n\\) columns of the augmented matrix (which correspond to the coefficient matrix) must all be pivot columns.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The augmented matrix must have a pivot in every column of the coefficient matrix.}}\n\\]"}

This means that\n\\[\n(f(1), f(2), \\cdots, f(n)) = (g(1), g(2), \\cdots, g(n)).\n\\]\nBy the definition of equality of ordered \\( n \\)-tuples, we have \\( f(i) = g(i) \\) for all \\( i \\in \\{1, 2, \\cdots, n\\} \\). Therefore, \\( f = g \\). This shows that \\(\\phi\\) is one-to-one.\n\n### Step 3: Show that \\(\\phi\\) is Onto\nLet \\((a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Define a function \\( f \\in V \\) by \\( f(i) = a_i \\) for all \\( i \\in \\{1, 2, \\cdots, n\\} \\).

The sum \\( f + g \\) is the function defined by \\((f + g)(i) = f(i) + g(i)\\) for all \\( i \\in \\{1, 2, \\cdots, n\\} \\). Then,\n\\[\n\\phi(f + g) = ((f + g)(1), (f + g)(2), \\cdots, (f + g)(n)) = (f(1) + g(1), f(2) + g(2), \\cdots, f(n) + g(n)) = \\phi(f) + \\phi(g).\n\\]\nThis shows that \\(\\phi\\) preserves vector addition.\n\n### Step 5: Show that \\(\\phi\\) Preserves Scalar Multiplication\nLet \\( f \\in V \\) and \\( c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). The scalar multiple \\( cf \\) is the function defined by \\((cf)(i) = cf(i)\\) for all \\( i \\in \\{1, 2, \\cdots, n\\} \\).

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \\(p/q\\), is a factor of the constant term (-6) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (4). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{4}, \\pm \\frac{3}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nLet's test these possible roots.

Since 6 inches is 0.5 feet, we have \\( x(0) = 0.5 \\).\n- The weight is given an upward velocity of 2 ft/s, so \\( x'(0) = -2 \\).\n\nFirst, apply the initial condition \\( x(0) = 0.5 \\):\n\n\\[ x(0) = C_1 \\cos 0 + C_2 \\sin 0 + \\frac{1}{3} \\sin 0 = C_1 = 0.5 \\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ x(t) = 0.5 \\cos 2t + C_2 \\sin 2t + \\frac{1}{3} \\sin t \\]\n\nNext, apply the initial condition \\( x'(0) = -2 \\). First, find the first derivative of \\( x(t) \\):\n\n\\[ x'(t) = -1 \\sin 2t + 2C_2 \\cos 2t + \\frac{1}{3} \\cos t \\]\n\nNow, apply the initial condition:\n\n\\[ x'(0) = -1 \\sin 0 + 2C_2 \\cos 0 + \\frac{1}{3} \\cos 0 = 2C_2 + \\frac{1}{3} = -2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( C_2 \\):\n\n\\[ 2C_2 = -2 - \\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{6}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\\[ C_2 = -\\frac{7}{6} \\]\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n\\[ x(t) = 0.5 \\cos 2t - \\frac{7}{6} \\sin 2t + \\frac{1}{3} \\sin t \\]\n\nTherefore, the displacement of the weight for \\( t > 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5 \\cos 2t - \\frac{7}{6} \\sin 2t + \\frac{1}{3} \\sin t} \\]"}

Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to simplify:\n   \\[\n   2 = 8 + 6\\sqrt{2x-1}\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with the square root:\n   \\[\n   -6 = 6\\sqrt{2x-1}\n   \\]\n\n5. Divide both sides by 6:\n   \\[\n   -1 = \\sqrt{2x-1}\n   \\]\n\n6. Since the square root of a real number cannot be negative, there is no real solution to the equation \\(-1 = \\sqrt{2x-1}\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No real solution}}\n\\]"}

If the determinant after swapping the rows is \\(-D\\), then after swapping the columns, the determinant becomes \\(-(-D) = D\\).\n\nTherefore, the combined effect of swapping the rows and then swapping the columns is that the determinant remains unchanged.\n\nThe determinant of the original matrix is:\n\\[\n\\det\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{array}\\right]\\right) = ad - bc\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of the resulting matrix is:\n\\[\n\\det\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\nb & a \\\\\nd & c\n\\end{array}\\right]\\right) = bc - ad = -(ad - bc)\n\\]\n\nSince the determinant of the resulting matrix is the same as the determinant of the original matrix, we conclude that the determinant remains unchanged.\n\nThus, the operation performed is a combination of row and column swaps, and the value of the determinant remains the same.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The determinant remains unchanged.}}\n\\]"}

We can use the quotient rule to find the derivative. The quotient rule states that if \\( y = \\frac{u}{v} \\), then \\( y' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} \\).\n\nHere, \\( u = x+1 \\) and \\( v = \\sqrt{5x^2 + 35} \\). So, \\( u' = 1 \\) and \\( v' = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{5x^2 + 35}} \\cdot 10x = \\frac{5x}{\\sqrt{5x^2 + 35}} \\).\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we get:\n\\[\ny' = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\sqrt{5x^2 + 35} - (x+1) \\cdot \\frac{5x}{\\sqrt{5x^2 + 35}}}{5x^2 + 35} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5x^2 + 35} - \\frac{5x(x+1)}{\\sqrt{5x^2 + 35}}}{5x^2 + 35} = \\frac{5x^2 + 35 - 5x^2 - 5x}{(5x^2 + 35)^{3/2}} = \\frac{35 - 5x}{(5x^2 + 35)^{3/2}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Set the first derivative equal to zero to find the critical points\n\nWe set \\( y' = 0 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{35 - 5x}{(5x^2 + 35)^{3/2}} = 0\n\\]\nThe denominator is never zero, so we only need to solve the numerator:\n\\[\n35 - 5x = 0 \\implies x = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, the critical point is \\( x = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the nature of the critical point\n\nWe can use the second derivative test to determine whether this critical point is a maximum or a minimum. First, we find the second derivative \\( y'' \\).\n\nStarting with the first derivative:\n\\[\ny' = \\frac{35 - 5x}{(5x^2 + 35)^{3/2}}\n\\]\nWe use the quotient rule again, where \\( u = 35 - 5x \\) and \\( v = (5x^2 + 35)^{3/2} \\). So, \\( u' = -5 \\) and \\( v' = \\frac{3}{2}(5x^2 + 35)^{1/2} \\cdot 10x = 15x(5x^2 + 35)^{1/2} \\).\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we get:\n\\[\ny'' = \\frac{-5(5x^2 + 35)^{3/2} - (35 - 5x) \\cdot 15x(5x^2 + 35)^{1/2}}{(5x^2 + 35)^3} = \\frac{-5(5x^2 + 35) - (35 - 5x) \\cdot 15x}{(5x^2 + 35)^{5/2}} = \\frac{-25x^2 - 175 - 525x + 75x^2}{(5x^2 + 35)^{5/2}} = \\frac{50x^2 - 525x - 175}{(5x^2 + 35)^{5/2}}\n\\]\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at \\( x = 7 \\):\n\\[\ny''(7) = \\frac{50(7)^2 - 525(7) - 175}{(5(7)^2 + 35)^{5/2}} = \\frac{2450 - 3675 - 175}{(245 + 35)^{5/2}} = \\frac{-1400}{280^{5/2}} < 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\( y''(7) < 0 \\), the function has a local maximum at \\( x = 7 \\).\n\nFinally, we find the value of \\( y \\) at \\( x = 7 \\):\n\\[\ny(7) = \\frac{7+1}{\\sqrt{5(7)^2 + 35}} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{245 + 35}} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{280}} = \\frac{8}{2\\sqrt{70}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{70}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{70}}{70} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{70}}{35}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the local maximum point is \\(\\boxed{\\left(7, \\frac{2\\sqrt{70}}{35}\\right)}\\).

The p-value only tells us whether the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis of independence, but it does not provide information about the magnitude of the deviation from independence.\n\nHere are the steps to check for practical significance:\n\n1. **Calculate the Effect Size**: Common effect size measures for categorical variables include Cramer's V, Cohen's w, or the contingency coefficient. Cramer's V is a measure of association between two nominal variables and is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   V = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\chi^2}{n(k-1)}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\chi^2\\) is the chi-squared statistic, \\(n\\) is the sample size, and \\(k\\) is the smaller of the number of rows or columns in the contingency table.\n\n2. **Interpret the Effect Size**: The value of Cramer's V ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no association and 1 indicates a perfect association. There are general guidelines for interpreting the magnitude of Cramer's V:\n   - Small effect: \\(V \\approx 0.1\\)\n   - Medium effect: \\(V \\approx 0.3\\)\n   - Large effect: \\(V \\approx 0.5\\)\n\n3. **Compare the Effect Size to a Benchmark**: Compare the calculated effect size to these benchmarks to determine if the deviation from independence is practically significant. If the effect size is small, even though the p-value is significant, the deviation from independence may not be practically important.\n\n4. **Consider the Context**: The practical significance also depends on the context of the study. In some fields, a small effect size might be considered practically significant, while in others, only a large effect size would be meaningful.\n\n5. **Visualize the Data**: Create a contingency table or a mosaic plot to visualize the distribution of the categories of the two variables. This can help to understand the pattern of the association and its practical implications.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine whether the deviation from independence is not only statistically significant but also practically significant. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Calculate the effect size, interpret it, compare it to a benchmark, consider the context, and visualize the data.}}\n\\]"}

However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize it fits a pattern that can be directly integrated to $\\frac{(u^2-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\frac{3}{2}} + C$ for the part involving $u^3$, but considering the initial simplification and the need for a precise match, we adjust our strategy to directly apply a known antiderivative or formula that matches the given integral's structure.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the correct formula or pattern\nGiven the structure of the integral and the simplification, we recognize that the solution involves directly applying a formula or recognizing a pattern that matches the integral's form. The integral $\\int \\frac{u^3}{\\sqrt{u^2-1}} du$ can be directly solved by recognizing it as a standard form that results in $\\frac{u\\sqrt{u^2-1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln|u + \\sqrt{u^2-1}| + C$, but considering the initial transformation and the need for precision, we adjust our approach to ensure alignment with the given problem's requirements.\n\n## Step 8: Adjust for the initial substitution and simplify\nGiven the initial substitution $u = 2x$, we need to adjust the solution to reflect this change. The solution involves back-substituting $u = 2x$ into the antiderivative and simplifying. However, recognizing the oversight in directly applying a formula without the precise substitution, we adjust our approach to ensure accuracy.\n\n## Step 9: Correctly apply the substitution and simplify\nGiven the integral's form and the substitution $u = 2x$, implying $du = 2dx$, we recognize the need to directly apply a formula or pattern that matches the integral's structure after substitution. The correct approach involves recognizing the integral as a form that can be directly integrated using a known formula or pattern, taking into account the initial substitution and simplification.\n\n## Step 10: Finalize the antiderivative\nConsidering the integral $\\frac{1}{16} \\int \\frac{u^3}{\\sqrt{u^2-1}} du$ and recognizing the need for a direct and accurate solution, we apply the correct formula or pattern. The antiderivative of $\\frac{u^3}{\\sqrt{u^2-1}}$ is recognized as a standard form, but the precise application and back-substitution are critical for accuracy.\n\n## Step 11: Correctly apply the formula and back-substitute\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision, we recognize the integral's solution involves directly applying a known formula or pattern, followed by careful back-substitution. The correct antiderivative, considering the initial substitution and simplification, is derived from recognizing the integral's standard form and accurately applying the substitution.\n\n## Step 12: Finalize the solution with correct back-substitution\nThe correct antiderivative, after careful consideration and application of the substitution $u = 2x$, is $\\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{(2x)^2\\sqrt{(2x)^2-1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\ln|2x + \\sqrt{(2x)^2-1}| + C$. Simplifying this expression gives the final antiderivative.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{4x^2-1}}{8} - \\frac{1}{16}\\ln|2x + \\sqrt{4x^2-1}| + C}$"}

We can substitute $x$ from the first equation into the second equation to solve for $y$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $x$ in the second equation\nSubstituting $x=1-y^{2}$ into $y=-x-1$ gives $y=-(1-y^{2})-1$. Simplifying this equation will help us find the values of $y$ at the intersection points.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $y$\nSimplifying the equation $y=-(1-y^{2})-1$ gives $y=-1+y^{2}-1$, which simplifies further to $y^{2}-y-2=0$. This is a quadratic equation that can be factored or solved using the quadratic formula.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation\nThe quadratic equation $y^{2}-y-2=0$ can be factored into $(y-2)(y+1)=0$. Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions $y=2$ and $y=-1$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the corresponding $x$ values\nSubstitute the $y$ values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding $x$ values. For $y=2$, using $x=1-y^{2}$ gives $x=1-2^{2}=-3$. For $y=-1$, it gives $x=1-(-1)^{2}=0$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the limits of integration\nThe intersection points are $(-3, 2)$ and $(0, -1)$. However, to find the area between the curves, we need to determine which curve is above the other within this interval. This can be done by testing a point within the interval or by analyzing the behavior of the functions.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the behavior of the functions\nGiven the nature of the functions, $x=1-y^{2}$ is a parabola opening left, and $y=-x-1$ is a line with a negative slope. The parabola will be above the line in the interval of interest.\n\n## Step 9: Set up the integral\nThe area $A$ between the curves from $y=-1$ to $y=2$ can be found by integrating the difference of the $x$ values with respect to $y$. The integral is $A = \\int_{-1}^{2} (1-y^{2}) - (-y-1) dy$.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the integral\nEvaluating the integral $A = \\int_{-1}^{2} (1-y^{2}+y+1) dy$ gives $A = \\int_{-1}^{2} (2-y^{2}+y) dy$. This simplifies to $A = \\left[2y - \\frac{y^{3}}{3} + \\frac{y^{2}}{2}\\right]_{-1}^{2}$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the antiderivative difference\nCalculating the antiderivative difference gives $A = \\left(2(2) - \\frac{2^{3}}{3} + \\frac{2^{2}}{2}\\right) - \\left(2(-1) - \\frac{(-1)^{3}}{3} + \\frac{(-1)^{2}}{2}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression gives $A = \\left(4 - \\frac{8}{3} + 2\\right) - \\left(-2 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 13: Final simplification\nFinal simplification yields $A = \\left(6 - \\frac{8}{3}\\right) - \\left(-2 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 14: Final calculation\nFinal calculation gives $A = \\frac{10}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{3}{6}\\right) = \\frac{10}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{9}{6} + \\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{20}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{24}{6} = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"}

The left side becomes $x^2 + 2x + 1$ and the right side becomes $3x + 7$.\n\nStep 3: Subtract $3x + 7$ from both sides to set the equation to zero. This gives us $x^2 + 2x + 1 - 3x - 7 = 0$.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation. This gives us $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$.\n\nStep 5: Factor the quadratic equation. The factors of $-6$ that add up to $-1$ (the coefficient of $x$) are $-3$ and $2$. So, we can write the equation as $(x - 3)(x + 2) = 0$.\n\nStep 6: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$.
